# Refrigeration Calc roadmap

## Future: WebView chart engine

Future chart engine option:
Consider WebView-based charts using Chart.js or Apache ECharts if the app
requires more advanced interactive charts, tooltips, legends, export options,
or richer animations. This should be evaluated only after the Kivy Canvas
implementation is stable. WebView charts may increase app complexity, APK/AAB
size, startup cost, and Android compatibility risk. Keep Kivy Canvas as the
default lightweight chart engine for now.

- TODO: Evaluate angle-based donut segment selection after device-level UX and
  accessibility tests of the lightweight Kivy Canvas chart.
